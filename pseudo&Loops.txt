How to make a peanut butter jelly sandwich:

Go get two slice bread from the counter
Place the slices on a plate
Get your peanut butter and jam from the fridge
Get a knife from the drawer

Place all of your items in one place
LOOP twice --
    If a slice of bread does not have a condiment on it
        If there is no peanut butter on the two slices
            Put peanut butter on the slice
        Else
            Put jam on the slice
    Else
        Fold the two slices of bread together, condiments toward each other

Loops Review

FOR:
for (initializer; condition; final statement){
    // Do stuff
}

While:
initializer;

while (condition){
    //do stuff
    final statement;
    //e.g. of final stat: "i++"
}

Do-While:

initializer;
//e.g.: let i = 0;
do {
    //do stuff; e.g. console.log("hello");
    final statement;
    //e.g.: i++;
} while (condition e.g.: i < 1); 

Note: 
--> Use "for" loop when you want to do something a specific amt of times--you already know the precise no. of times.
--> Use "while" when you don't know how many iterations you need.
--> Use "do-while" when you know you're going to run your code **at least** once. Thereafter, the iterations are dependent on a specific condition.
